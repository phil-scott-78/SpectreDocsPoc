A conceptual comparison that explains what Spectre.Console offers over standard `System.Console`. It briefly outlines the shortcomings of basic console printing (no built-in color, manual spacing for tables, etc.) and how Spectre.Console addresses those with higher-level abstractions (markup, panels, tables, etc.). It might highlight the inspiration from the Python Rich library, explaining how Spectre.Console takes similar approaches in a .NET context. This is more of a background discussion, giving context on why to use Spectre.Console and how it fits into building modern CLI applications.
