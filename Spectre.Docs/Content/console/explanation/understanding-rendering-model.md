An in-depth explanation of how Spectre.Console renders text and widgets to the terminal. This article discusses the console **Capabilities** detection (how it checks for ANSI support, Unicode capability, terminal type, etc.) and how that influences rendering. It explains concepts like measuring content width and auto-adjusting to console window size, and how Spectre.Console avoids flicker by rendering off-screen (if applicable) then updating. It also covers how **IRenderable** objects work â€“ describing that most widgets implement `IRenderable` and the console simply calls their render logic. This section might also touch on performance considerations and how updating works (e.g. the render loop for live widgets). It gives readers a mental model of what happens when they call `AnsiConsole.Write` or update a live widget, enhancing their understanding of the library's internals.
