When your console output contains multiple sections that need organized placement—like side-by-side comparisons, highlighted messages, or centered headings—use layout widgets to structure the display. Wrap important messages in `Panel` to draw attention with borders, or use `Align` and `Padder` to position content precisely within regions.

For multi-section layouts, use `Grid` to arrange content in rows and columns, or `Columns` and `Rows` containers to place widgets side-by-side or stacked. Center banners or art with `Align.Center` to create professional-looking headers. These layout tools let you compose complex console UIs from smaller widgets, keeping output organized and scannable even when displaying multiple data sources simultaneously.
