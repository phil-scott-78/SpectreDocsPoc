When you need to display structured data—like API results, file listings, or hierarchical information—in an easy-to-read format, use the `Table` and `Tree` widgets. Create a table by defining columns, adding rows of data, and choosing border styles (from simple to double lines) and alignment options to match your needs.

For hierarchical data like directory structures or nested objects, build a `Tree` by adding nodes and styling each level. Customize borders, handle wide content gracefully, and adjust column widths to ensure your data fits clearly in the terminal. This makes complex data scannable and professional-looking in console output.
