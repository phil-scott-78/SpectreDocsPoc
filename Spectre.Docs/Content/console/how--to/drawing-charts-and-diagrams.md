When you need to visualize metrics, breakdowns, or trends directly in the terminal—like comparing task durations, showing percentage distributions, or highlighting important dates—use the charting widgets. Create bar charts with `BarChart` by supplying data series and labels, or use `BreakdownChart` for pie-chart-like percentage displays with custom colors for each segment.

Add visual structure with `Calendar` to render monthly views that highlight specific dates, or use `Rule` to draw separators that act as timeline markers or section breaks. These widgets transform raw numbers into scannable visual representations without leaving the console, making your tool's output more informative and user-friendly.
