When you want to make your console application stand out with eye-catching headers, banners, or decorated section titles, use the `Figlet` text renderer to generate large ASCII-art text from strings. Choose from various fonts and apply colors to match your branding or create visual hierarchy in output.

Add personality and clarity with emoji shortcodes (`:shortcode:`) to insert icons that enrich messages. Combine Figlet banners with `Rule` separators to create distinct sections that guide users through your tool's output. Spectre.Console handles font compatibility automatically with fallbacks, ensuring your decorative text displays correctly across different terminal environments.
