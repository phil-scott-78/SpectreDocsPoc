The Layout widget provides a powerful system for creating complex, nested layouts by dividing the console space into sections that can be split horizontally or vertically. It's the most sophisticated layout tool in Spectre.Console for building dashboard-style interfaces and complex screen layouts.

**Key Topics Covered:**

* **Layout structure** - Understanding how Layout divides space into sections that can be further subdivided
* **Splitting sections** - Using `SplitRows()` and `SplitColumns()` to divide layout sections horizontally and vertically
* **Size constraints** - Controlling section sizes with fixed heights/widths, ratios, or auto-sizing
* **Accessing sections** - Navigating the layout tree to access and populate specific sections by index
* **Updating content** - Changing the content of layout sections dynamically
* **Nested layouts** - Creating complex multi-level layouts with recursive splitting
* **Ratio-based sizing** - Using proportional sizing to create responsive layouts
* **Minimum sizes** - Setting minimum dimensions for sections to prevent over-compression
