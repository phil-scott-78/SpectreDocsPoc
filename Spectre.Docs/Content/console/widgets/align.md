The Align widget provides explicit control over horizontal and vertical alignment of any renderable content, allowing you to position elements precisely within available space. It's particularly useful for centering content, right-aligning elements, or creating specific positional layouts.

**Key Topics Covered:**

* **Horizontal alignment** - Left, center, and right alignment within available width
* **Vertical alignment** - Top, middle, and bottom alignment within available height
* **Combined alignment** - Setting both horizontal and vertical alignment simultaneously
* **Width expansion** - Controlling whether content expands to fill width or uses minimum required space
* **Use cases** - Centering titles, right-aligning numbers, positioning UI elements
* **Composition with other widgets** - Using Align within panels, tables, grids, and other layout containers
* **Console width considerations** - How alignment behaves with different console widths
