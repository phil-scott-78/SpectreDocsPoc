The BreakdownChart widget displays data as proportional colored segments in a horizontal bar, similar to a progress bar but showing multiple values that sum to a whole. It's perfect for visualizing percentages, resource allocation, categorical distributions, and "parts of a whole" data.

**Key Topics Covered:**

* **Adding items** - Using `AddItem()` to add labeled values that will be displayed proportionally
* **Proportional rendering** - How values are automatically converted to proportional segments
* **Colors and labels** - Assigning distinct colors to each segment and showing descriptive labels
* **Width control** - Setting the total width of the breakdown chart
* **Tag display** - Showing segment labels with values or percentages
* **Tag formatting** - Customizing how segment information is displayed
* **Use cases** - Disk space usage, memory allocation, survey results, budget breakdown, test results
