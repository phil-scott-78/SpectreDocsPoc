The Tree widget visualizes hierarchical data structures with parent-child relationships using Unicode tree characters (├─, └─, │). It's ideal for displaying file systems, organizational charts, dependency graphs, and any nested data structures.

> [!NOTE]
> See the [Tree Guide Reference](/console/reference/tree-guide-reference) for a complete visual guide to all available tree guide styles.

**Key Topics Covered:**

* **Tree structure** - Creating root nodes and building hierarchical relationships with `AddNode()`
* **Node content** - Using plain text, markup, or any renderable as node content
* **Tree styles** - Selecting from various tree line styles (ASCII, Unicode, rounded, etc.)
* **Expanding/collapsing** - Controlling which nodes are expanded by default (all trees are static, not interactive)
* **Styling nodes** - Applying colors and styles to individual nodes or entire branches
* **Guide lines** - Customizing the vertical and horizontal lines connecting tree nodes
* **Recursive structures** - Building deeply nested trees from hierarchical data sources
