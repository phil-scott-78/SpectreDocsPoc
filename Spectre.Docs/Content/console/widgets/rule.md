The Rule widget renders horizontal lines across the console width, perfect for visually separating sections, creating headers, or adding structure to output. Rules can include optional centered or aligned titles for section headings.

> [!NOTE]
> See the [Box Border Reference](/console/reference/box-border-reference) for examples of all available line styles.

**Key Topics Covered:**

* **Basic rules** - Creating simple horizontal dividers with `new Rule()` that span the full console width
* **Titled rules** - Adding text to rules for section headers using `new Rule("[blue]Section Title[/]")`
* **Title alignment** - Positioning rule titles (left, center, right) along the horizontal line
* **Rule styles** - Choosing from various line styles (single, double, heavy, ASCII, etc.) to match visual themes
* **Use cases** - Separating output sections, creating visual headers, organizing long output streams
