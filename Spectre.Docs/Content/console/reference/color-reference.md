Spectre.Console provides a comprehensive set of named colors that can be used throughout the library.
These colors work with markup strings, styling, and all color-enabled components.

## Usage Example

```csharp
// Using named colors
AnsiConsole.MarkupLine("[red]Error:[/] Something went wrong");
AnsiConsole.MarkupLine("[blue on yellow]Highlighted text[/]");

// Using Color struct
var style = new Style(Color.Aqua, Color.Black);
AnsiConsole.Write("Styled text", style);
```

## Important Notes

- **Terminal Support:** Color rendering depends on your terminal's capabilities. Modern terminals support 256 colors or true color (24-bit).
- **Hex Values:** Each color has an associated hex value that represents its RGB components.
- **Fallback:** Spectre.Console automatically handles color degradation for terminals with limited color support.
