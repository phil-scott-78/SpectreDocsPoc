An explanatory deep-dive into what happens from the moment `app.Run(args)` is called to when a command finishes execution. It describes:

* **Parsing Phase**: how the arguments array is parsed against the configured commands and settings, how Spectre.Console.Cli matches arguments to `CommandSettings` properties (and provides errors if something is wrong).
* **Validation Phase**: how and when the library calls `Validate()` on settings or commands (e.g., does it validate CommandSettings by invoking an optional `Validate` method on settings class or just the command's override as documented).
* **Execution Phase**: how the appropriate `Command` instance is constructed (using DI if available), then `Execute` or `ExecuteAsync` is called.
* **Post-Execution**: handling the result (the int exit code) and any exception propagation or interception.
* **Help invocation**: mention that if `--help` is detected, the above phases short-circuit to display help instead of executing a command.
  This explanation might include a simple flow diagram or description: Input args -> Parser selects Command -> Settings populated -> If parse errors, show error/help -> If ok, create Command -> (Interceptor before) -> Execute -> (Interceptor after) -> return exit code. By understanding this flow, users can reason about behaviors like why their code in `Execute` might not run (e.g. if parsing failed or validation failed first).
