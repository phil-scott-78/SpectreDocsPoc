A high-level comparison that situates Spectre.Console.Cli in the ecosystem (optional, but could be useful conceptually). It might briefly compare to frameworks like **System.CommandLine**, **CommandLineParser**, or others, highlighting Spectre.Console.Cli's unique approach (heavy use of attributes and class hierarchy, integrated with Spectre.Console for output). It explains the trade-offs of this approach: for instance, being opinionated means less flexibility in some parsing scenarios, but usually a quicker setup for common patterns. This is more of an editorial piece to help advanced users or those evaluating libraries to understand Spectre.Console.Cli's strengths (like strong typing, built-in DI support, automatic help) versus alternatives. (If the official docs prefer not to mention other libraries, this section could be omitted or kept generic.)
