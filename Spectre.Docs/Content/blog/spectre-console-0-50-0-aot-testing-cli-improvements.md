Spectre.Console 0.50.0: AOT Testing CLI Improvements

We're excited to announce Spectre.Console 0.50.0, a major release that brings Native AOT support, comprehensive testing enhancements, and significant improvements to the command-line interface framework. This release represents a substantial step forward in making Spectre.Console more compatible with modern .NET deployment scenarios while improving the developer experience.

## What's New in 0.50.0

### Native AOT Compatibility

One of the biggest additions in this release is Native AOT (Ahead-of-Time) support, making Spectre.Console applications faster to start and smaller in size:

- **AOT compatibility layers** added throughout the codebase (Phil Scott)
- **Fallback exception formatting** for AOT scenarios where reflection is limited (Phil Scott)
- **Enhanced type conversion** with AOT-compatible fallbacks (Phil Scott)
- **Assembly name resolution improvements** for better F# integration in AOT (Phil Scott)
- **Explicit AOT incompatibility warnings** for Spectre.Console.Cli to guide developers (Phil Scott)

### Testing Framework Overhaul

This release includes comprehensive improvements to testing capabilities:

- **New testing documentation** with detailed guides and examples (Frank Ray)
- **Enhanced CommandAppTester** with configurable output trimming (Frank Ray)
- **Improved unit test coverage** across all major components (Frank Ray)
- **Version command testing** ensuring proper CLI behavior (Frank Ray)
- **Strict parsing tests** for better reliability (Frank Ray)

### Command-Line Interface Enhancements

The CLI framework received significant attention with numerous improvements:

- **Smart version handling** - version flags now work correctly even with default commands (Frank Ray)
- **Enhanced argument parsing** with better unknown flag handling (Frank Ray)
- **Improved help generation** with configurable colors and better formatting (Frank Ray)
- **Fluent configurator** now returns `IConfigurator` for method chaining (Melvin Dommer)
- **Better error handling** for invalid command configurations (Frank Ray)

### User Interface Polish

Several UI components received improvements:

- **Async spinner extension methods** for better async/await patterns (Phil Scott)
- **Enhanced multi-selection prompts** with improved checkbox styling (Davide Piccinini)
- **Tree component fixes** for expanded node display (Davide Piccinini)
- **Calendar highlighting** for single events (Davide Piccinini)
- **Progress task positioning** allowing tasks to be inserted before or after existing ones (Tom Longhurst)

### Developer Experience Improvements

- **Three-digit hex color parsing** support (Martijn Straathof)
- **Automatic command settings registration** reducing boilerplate (Patrik Svensson)
- **Spanish translations** for help strings (Daniel Cazzulino)
- **Exception formatting enhancements** for generic types (Cédric Luthi)
- **Transfer speed column configuration** with bits/bytes and binary/decimal prefixes (Tim Pilius)

### Performance and Reliability

- **Emoji dictionary optimization** using OrdinalIgnoreCase for better performance (Phil Scott)
- **Dependency updates** including .NET 9.0 support (Patrik Svensson)
- **Strong name signing** for all assemblies (Kirill Osenkov)
- **Progress percentage calculation** improvements when max value is zero (Frank Ray)

## Breaking Changes

- **Assembly strong naming** may affect some reflection-based scenarios
- **CLI version handling** behavior has changed - version flags are now opt-in
- **Some internal APIs** have been restructured for AOT compatibility

## Key Contributors

Special thanks to the amazing contributors who made this release possible:

- **Phil Scott**: Native AOT support and numerous infrastructure improvements
- **Frank Ray**: Testing framework overhaul and CLI enhancements
- **Patrik Svensson**: Project coordination and core improvements
- **Davide Piccinini**: UI component enhancements and bug fixes
- **Cédric Luthi**: Exception handling improvements
- **Tom Longhurst**: Progress task positioning features

## Migration Guide

Most applications will upgrade seamlessly, but note:

1. **Version handling**: If you rely on automatic version flags, you may need to explicitly enable them
2. **Strong naming**: Applications using reflection might need updates
3. **AOT scenarios**: CLI applications are not recommended for AOT - use core Spectre.Console instead

## Get Started

Update your package reference:

```xml
<PackageReference Include="Spectre.Console" Version="0.50.0" />
```

This release sets the foundation for our upcoming 1.0 release with robust AOT support, comprehensive testing, and a polished developer experience. We're excited to see what you build with these new capabilities!
